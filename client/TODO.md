# Short Term
1. Establish a simple client code to connect via a modifiable TLS protocol
2. Test it w/o certificates with a simple webserver
# Long Term
1. Set up reading from the private blockchain to check certificates
2. Set up checking public key ownership against the blockchain before completing connection
3. Test w/ valid and invalid public keys
