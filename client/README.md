# Blockchain certificate checking client

- Gets serial number from server (in this case 0)
- Checks if connected to blockchain before calling contract functions
- Gets pk and domain from certificate (right now printing just the domain)
- Use message.txt for abi or the one copied into the code
- Change IPC path to the one specified on your machine

Commented out sections allow for different connection options (auto/manual)
